This gem provides a simple API for creating emails within a Mack application.

A simple Mack::Mailer model would look like this:

  class WelcomeEmail
    include Mack::Mailer
  end
  
To use this in your application you would do something like the following:
 
  mail = WelcomeEmail.new
  mail.to = "foo@example.com"
  mail.from = "me@example.com"
  mail.subject = "Hello"
  mail.text_body = "This is my plain text body"
  mail.html_body = "This is my <b>HTML</b> body"
  mail.attach(Mack::Mailer::Attachment.new("/path/to/my/image_file.png"))
  mail.attach(Mack::Mailer::Attachment.new("/path/to/my/pdf_file.pdf"))
  mail.deliver
  
This gem currently has an adapter for TMail, but it can support any mailing
framework under the covers with the creation of a simple adapter class.

Currently implemented delivery handlers are: SMTP (default), sendmail, and test.

== Testing

When testing you can get access to delivered emails with the delivered_emails
method. After each tests these emails will be flushed our of the test handler.

== Rake tasks
  
  # Generates a mailer model, a test, and text and html template files.
  rake generate:mailer
