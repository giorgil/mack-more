== Page Caching

Using page caching with Mack, is incredibly easy. The first thing you 
need to do is turn it on. In the app_config/*.yml file of your chosing
place the following configuration setting:

  use_page_caching: true
  
That will now enable your application to use the page caching system.
A restart of your application is required for this to take effect.

Now that your application is using page caching, provided by the 
Cachetastic gem, you need to tell it which controllers/actions you want
to cache.

To cache all the actions in your controller you would do something like
the following:

  class UsersController
    include Mack::Controller
    
    cache_pages
    
    # ...
    #  actions omitted
    # ...
    
  end
  
The cache_pages method takes similar inputs to before/after filters. If
you want to be more specific you can use either the :only or :except flags.

  cache_pages :only => [:index, :show]

or

  cache_pages :except => [:delete, :edit, :update]
