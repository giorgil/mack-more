Paths
========================================================================

This simple gem gives applications some very simple methods to allow
developers to easily access the all the important directory paths for a 
Mack application.

===Examples:

  Mack::Paths.views # => <MACK_PROJECT_ROOT>/app/views
  Mack::Paths.plugins # => <MACK_PROJECT_ROOT>/vendor/plugins
